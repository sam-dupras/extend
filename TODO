- Implement @singleton
- Implement @trait     so that we can mixin things in existing classes
- Implement @prototype (maybe it's too redundant with singleton)

- Reference to 'this' in classes, when 'this' can be altered (by jQuery for instance)

- Add error/warn/info
- Add isActionScript isJavaScript
- Add sprintf


- Find a way so that meta-information can be more lightweight (and automatically
  updated)
